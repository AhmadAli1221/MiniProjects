This repository contains some beginner python projects that I built for practicing python.
The following is the detail of these projects:-

1: Password Manager:- As the name implies, a python file to manage your passwords in a txt file, but in an encrypted format for security purposes. To use it, first you need to create a key. It can be done by using generate_key function in the code. First run the code to generate key and then comment it out as before. It will generate a key file in the folder where you have PasswordManager.py file. After that, just run the program and add as many passwords you want. You can not directly access the passwords in txt file as it is in encrypted format. To view the passwords, you'll need the program and key file.
