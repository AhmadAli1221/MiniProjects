This repository contains some beginner python projects that I built for practicing python.
The following is the detail of these projects:-

1: Password Manager:- As the name implies, a python file to manage your passwords in a txt file, but in an encrypted format for security purposes. To use it, first you need to create a key. It can be done by using generate_key function in the code. First run the code to generate key and then comment it out as before. It will generate a key file in the folder where you have PasswordManager.py file. After that, just run the program and add as many passwords you want. You can not directly access the passwords in txt file as it is in encrypted format. To view the passwords, you'll need the program and key file.

2: PIG:- It's a type of gambling game where 2 or more players can play (2 to 4 in case of my program, however you can change that from code easily). The rules are simple, in each iteration, every player gets a turn. In that turn, player can choose to roll the dice (which adds to your score, 2 to 6 depending on your luck) or the player can choose to quit their turn. If they get a 1, all their score and that turn would be lost and next player's turn will start. You can roll as many times you like to add to your score increasing the chance of high score in just a single turn but also increasing the risk of losing all your score and turn if you get a 1. The player who reaches 35 score first wins. Winner will be decided at the end of iteration so everyone gets equal number of chances. In case of more players passing the threshold score, the winner will be determined by maximum score.
